    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a software system that allows for the storage, management, and retrieval of data. It can be\n",
    "thought of as an organized collection of data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database systems with\n",
    "distinct characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined columns and data types. \n",
    "These databases use SQL, a domain-specific programming language, to perform operations on the data such as\n",
    "querying, inserting, updating, and deleting. SQL databases are highly structured and well-suited for managing \n",
    "structured data. Some popular examples of SQL databases are MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, store data in a non-tabular format and are often used to manage unstructured\n",
    "data such as text, images, and videos. NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, allowing for more \n",
    "flexibility in the types of data they can store. These databases are highly scalable, distributed, and\n",
    "fault-tolerant, making them suitable for managing large amounts of data. Some popular examples of NoSQL databases \n",
    "are MongoDB, Cassandra, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are well-suited for structured data that requires a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases\n",
    "are better suited for unstructured and rapidly changing data. However, the choice between the two depends on the \n",
    "specific requirements of the application, the type of data being stored, and the performance and scalability needs.\n"
